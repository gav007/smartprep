    "question": "What are two ways to protect a computer from malware? (Choose two.)",
    "options": {
      "A": "Defragment the hard disk.",
      "B": "Keep software up to date.",
      "C": "Delete unused software.",
      "D": "Empty the browser cache.",
      "E": "Use antivirus software."
    },
    "answer": ["B", "E"],
    "feedback": "Keeping operating systems and applications updated with security patches (B) closes vulnerabilities that malware can exploit. Using reputable antivirus/anti-malware software and keeping its definitions up to date (E) helps detect and remove malware."

    "question": "A small advertising company has a web server that provides critical business service. The company connects to the Internet through a leased line service to an ISP. Which approach best provides cost effective redundancy for the Internet connection?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Add a second NIC to the web server.",
      "B": "Add another web server to prepare failover support.",
      "C": "Add a connection to the Internet via a DSL line to another ISP.",
      "D": "Add multiple connections between the switches and the edge router."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "feedback": "To provide redundant Internet connectivity, you need a second connection to the internet. Adding a connection from a different ISP using a potentially different technology (like DSL) provides diversity and resilience against outages affecting the primary connection or ISP. This is typically more cost-effective for a small company than a second leased line."

    "question": "Only employees connected to IPv6 interfaces are having difficulty connecting to remote networks. The analyst wants to verify that IPv6 routing has been enabled. What is the best command to use to accomplish the task?",
    "options": {
      "A": "show interfaces",
      "B": "show ip nat translations",
      "C": "copy running-config startup-config",
      "D": "show running-config"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "feedback": "IPv6 unicast routing is enabled globally on a Cisco router using the command `ipv6 unicast-routing`. To verify if this command is present and active, the `show running-config` command is used to display the current configuration in RAM."

    "question": "Which two commands could be used to check if DNS name resolution is working properly on a Windows PC? (Choose two.)",
    "options": {
      "A": "nbtstat cisco.com",
      "B": "ping cisco.com",
      "C": "net cisco.com",
      "D": "ipconfig /flushdns",
      "E": "nslookup cisco.com"
    },
    "answer": ["B", "E"],
    "feedback": "Pinging a hostname (B) requires the PC to perform a DNS lookup to resolve the name to an IP address before sending ICMP packets, implicitly testing DNS resolution. `nslookup hostname` (E) is a direct tool to query DNS servers for name resolution."

    "question": "Two network engineers are discussing the methods used to forward frames through a switch. What is an important concept related to the cut-through method of switching?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Fast-forward switching can be viewed as a compromise between store-and-forward switching and fragment-free switching.",
      "B": "The fragment-free switching offers the lowest level of latency.",
      "C": "Packets can be relayed with errors when fast-forward switching is used.",
      "D": "Fragment-free switching is the typical cut-through method of switching."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "feedback": "Cut-through switching, particularly fast-forward, begins forwarding the frame before the entire frame is received and the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is verified. This means that frames containing errors may be forwarded onto the network, unlike store-and-forward switching."

    "question": "Which two issues can cause both runts and giants in Ethernet networks? (Choose two.)",
    "options": {
      "A": "using the incorrect cable type",
      "B": "electrical interference on serial interfaces",
      "C": "CRC errors",
      "D": "half-duplex operations",
      "E": "a malfunctioning NIC"
    },
    "answer": ["A", "E"],
    "feedback": "Runts (undersized frames) and giants (oversized frames) are typically caused by physical layer problems like signal issues from incorrect cabling (A) or faults in the network interface card (NIC) (E) that result in the transmission of malformed frames."

    "type": "MC_MA",
    "question": "Which two functions are performed at the LLC sublayer of the OSI Data Link Layer to facilitate Ethernet communication? (Choose two.)",
    "options": {
      "A": "places information in the Ethernet frame that identifies which network layer protocol is being encapsulated by the frame",
      "B": "applies source and destination MAC addresses to Ethernet frame",
      "C": "adds Ethernet control information to network protocol data",
      "D": "implements CSMA/CD over legacy shared half-duplex media",
      "E": "integrates Layer 2 flows between 10 Gigabit Ethernet over fiber and 1 Gigabit Ethernet over copper"
    },
    "answer": ["A", "E"],
    "feedback": "The LLC sublayer provides the interface to the network layer, identifying the encapsulated network protocol (A). It also handles flow control and error handling (though not heavily used in Ethernet). Option E relates to LLC's role in providing a consistent interface to different MAC types."

    "type": "MC",
    "question": "What happens when a switch receives a frame and the calculated CRC value is different than the value that is in the FCS field?",
    "options": {
      "A": "The switch drops the frame.",
      "B": "The switch places the new CRC value in the FCS field and forwards the frame.",
      "C": "The switch notifies the source of the bad frame.",
      "D": "The switch floods the frame to all ports except the port through which the frame arrived to notify the hosts of the error."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "feedback": "Switches that perform error checking (like store-and-forward switches) compare the calculated CRC of the received frame with the value in the FCS field. If they do not match, indicating data corruption, the switch drops the frame."
